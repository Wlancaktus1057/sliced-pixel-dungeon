actors.mobs.dm100.name=DM-100
actors.mobs.dm100.zap_kill=The lightning bolt killed you...
actors.mobs.dm100.desc=The DM-100 is an early model of dwarven 'defense machine' which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves below this prison. Their electrical shocks proved too weak however, and so they were gifted to the human prison above. The warden initially deemed them too cruel to use, but as the prisoners became more unruly they became a necessity.

actors.mobs.dm200.name=DM-200
actors.mobs.dm200.vent=The DM-200 fires a jet of toxic exhaust!
actors.mobs.dm200.desc=The DM-200 is the second generation of dwarven 'defense machine', which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves and city below. They are much larger and bulkier than their predecessors, and attack with devastating hydraulic fists.\n\nTheir increased size is also their primary weakness, as they are unable to fit into the narrow tunnels and doorways of the dungeon. The dwarves were able to compensate for the DM-200's lack of mobility by allowing them to vent their toxic exhaust fumes at distant enemies, or enemies they cannot reach.

actors.mobs.dm201.name=DM-201
actors.mobs.dm201.vent=The DM-201 lobs a corrosive grenade!
actors.mobs.dm201.desc=The dwarves briefly experimented with more heavily emphasizing the DM-200's lack of mobility and created some DM models that are entirely stationary. The DM-201 is a retrofitted DM-200 which acts as a sentry turret that has no movement ability. In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the dwarves instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

actors.mobs.dm300.desc=The DM-300 is the largest and most powerful 'defense machine' that the dwarves ever built. Such an awesome machine is difficult to manufacture, so the dwarves only ever made a few to guard the entrances to their underground metropolis.\n\nIt is equipped with vents to jet its toxic exhaust fumes and a high power drill that it can use both to attack and disrupt the earth. DM-300 can also connect to an energy grid, further enhancing its power.
actors.mobs.dm300.desc_supercharged=DM-300 is currently charged full of electrical energy. In this form DM-300 cannot be damaged and moves at double speed! Additionally, its drill now spins fast enough for it to _tunnel through solid rock,_ though it moves much more slowly when doing this.\n\nAttacking DM-300 directly is pointless while it is supercharged, but _something in the area must be providing it with this energy,_ destroying that may weaken it.

While they are capable of melee combat, their true strength comes from their magic.\n\nAfter building energy for a short time an Evil Eye will unleash a devastating beam of energy called the _deathgaze._ Anything within the Evil Eye's sights will take tremendous damage, wise adventurers will run for cover.

actors.mobs.fetidrat.name=fetid rat
actors.mobs.fetidrat.desc=Something is clearly wrong with this rat. Its greasy black fur and rotting skin are very different from the healthy rats you've seen previously. Its pale green eyes make it seem especially menacing.\n\nThe rat carries a cloud of horrible stench with it, it's overpoweringly strong up close.\n\nDark ooze dribbles from the rat's mouth, it eats through the floor but seems to dissolve in water.

actors.mobs.ghoul.name=dwarven ghoul
actors.mobs.ghoul.desc=As dwarven society slowly began to collapse, and the current king of the dwarves seized absolute power, those who were weak or who resisted him were not treated well. As the king grew more adept at wielding dark magic, he bent these dwarves to his will, and now they make up the footsoldiers of his army.\n\nGhouls are not especially strong on their own, but always travel in groups and are much harder to kill in large numbers. _When a ghoul is defeated, it will rise again after a few turns as long as another ghoul is nearby._
